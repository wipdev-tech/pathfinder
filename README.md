## Installation

*Coming Soonâ„¢*

### From source

- Ensure Go is installed

```

## Usage

> **Disclaimer:**
> As of right now, this tool has been only tested on Linux.

- To list available commands run the following

```bash
pathfinder help  # `pathfinder` only will also work
```

- To list paths in your PATH variable run the following

```bash
pathfinder list
```

- To *temporarily* add a new path to your PATH variable run the following

```bash
pathfinder add /your/new/path
```

- To *permanently* add a new path to your PATH variable run the following
    + This adds a command to your `.bashrc`, and you will be prompted before proceeding
    + The PATH variable is also modified for the current session - no restart needed

```bash
pathfinder add /your/new/path --persist
```
